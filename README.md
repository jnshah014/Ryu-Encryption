# Ryu Encryption

## 1) Introduction
This repository contains the all the current versions of the 'Ryu Encryption' software. 'Ryu Encryption' is a lightweight tool to encrypt small amounts of data and currently offers 3 encryption levels.

### 1.1) Description
My aim for this project was to create an encryption software that offered 3 different levels of security, each of which uses a different process to encrypt data (and conversely decrypt data). The strength (and computational power needed) of the algorithms increase with the level. I aimed to create a user interface using Python's `tkinter` module to allow the user to enter inputs and access outputs. Level 1 was to use a Caesar Cipher, Level 2 was to use a Grid Cipher and Level 3 was to use a Cumulative Cyclic Caesar Cipher (please see below for more information). I aim to set myself a total of 5 hours - an hour per day - to complete this project. Please see my checklist below of the subtasks I had to complete.

#### User-based Objective
To provide a lightweight and fast tool to encrypt small amounts of data.

#### Personal Objective
To learn how to create a GUI as well as full-stack development.

### 1.2) Subtasks
- Frontend GUI
  - Main Menu
  - Encryption Screen
  - Decryption Screen
  - Input / Output Fields
- Input Validation Checks
- Backend Algorithms
  - Level 1
  - Level 2
  - Level 3
  - Character Shift Function 

### 1.3) Encryption Levels
#### Level 1 (Caesar Cipher)
N.B. This is the official name for this Cipher

#### Level 2 (Grid Cipher)
N.B. This is **not** the official name for this Cipher

#### Level 3 (Cumulative Cyclic Caesar Cipher)
N.B. This is **not** the official name for this Cipher

### 1.4) User Requirements
- GUI
  - Ability for the User to access the Main Screen
  - Ability for the User to access the Encryption Screen
  - Ability for the User to access the Decryption Screen
  - Inability for the User to resize any Screens
- Validation
  - Ability for the User to recieve a Warning when their Key does not match the following conditions:
    - 8 characters or over in length
    - Contains at least 1 non-alphanumeric character
- Algorithms
  - Ability for the User to Encrypt Data using Level 1
  - Ability for the User to Decrypt Data using Level 1
  - Ability for the User to Encrypt Data using Level 2
  - Ability for the User to Decrypt Data using Level 2
  - Ability for the User to Encrypt Data using Level 3
  - Ability for the User to Decrypt Data using Level 3

## 2) Current System in place
```python
def import(self):
  print(self.__init__)
  return nL
```
