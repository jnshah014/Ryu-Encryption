## 1) Introduction
This repository contains the all the current versions of the 'Ryu Encryption' software. 'Ryu Encryption' is a lightweight tool to encrypt small amounts of data and currently offers 3 encryption levels.

### 1.1) Description
My aim for this project was to create an encryption software that offered 3 different levels of security, each of which uses a different process to encrypt data (and conversely decrypt data). The strength (and computational power needed) of the algorithms increase with the level. I aimed to create a user interface using Python's `tkinter` module to allow the user to enter inputs and access outputs. Level 1 was to use a Caesar Cipher, Level 2 was to use a Grid Cipher and Level 3 was to use a Cumulative Cyclic Caesar Cipher (please see below for more information). I aimed to set myself a total of 5 hours - an hour per day - to complete this project. Please see my checklist below of the subtasks I had to complete.

#### User-based Objective
To provide a lightweight and fast tool to encrypt small amounts of data.

#### Personal Objective
To learn how to create a GUI as well learning full-stack development.

### 1.2) Subtasks
- Frontend GUI
  - Main Menu
  - Encryption Screen
  - Decryption Screen
  - Input / Output Fields
- Input Validation Checks
- Backend Algorithms
  - Level 1
  - Level 2
  - Level 3
  - Character Shift Function 

### 1.3) Encryption Levels
#### Level 1 (Caesar Cipher)
N.B. This is the official name for this Cipher

Caesar Cipher is a type of 'Substitution Cipher' whereby each character in the plaintext is replaced by a character that is a fixed number of positions down a character set. Normally, the character set used is the English Latin-script alphabet. My character set (shown below) is in the form of a python list called `ascii_accepted_list`; it contains the letters for the ascii values 32 `[SPACE]` up to the value 126 `~` (tilde) and my program executes an error message if there are characters outside this range. The user-inputed key is converted to a number between 1 and 94 by the `key_product.py` script. Although there are 95 characters in the list, this range ensures that the characters are at least shifted by 1 place. A range of 0 to 95 would allow 2/96ths of the shifts to be by 0 places, hence making the algorithm redundant. 

```python
ascii_accepted_list = [chr(i) for i in range(32, 126 + 1)]
```

For more information visit [Wikipedia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) page.

#### Level 2 (Grid Cipher)
N.B. This is **not** the official name for this Cipher

This Cipher is best explained with an example.

The orginal character set would appear like a 2-dimensional grid like below:
```
[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]
```
The key (after processing by the `key_product.py` script) appears as a tuple of two numbers. Eg: `(2, 1)`. The first number, shifts the letters **up** by the number of places represented by the number. The second number shifts the letters **right** by the number of places represented by the number.
```
Initial     New
[a b c]     [i g h]
[d e f] --> [c a b]
[g h i]     [f d e]
```
Then each letter in the plaintext becomes the letter that is now in its place in the new grid. Eg: `a --> i`, `b --> g`, `c --> h` etc.

#### Level 3 (Cumulative Cyclic Caesar Cipher)
N.B. This is **not** the official name for this Cipher

This Cipher is similar to the Caesar Cipher but is more intricate and is best explained with an example. Let the `plaintext = "hello"` and the key (after processing by the `key_product.py` script) to be `key = 126798`. Then break `key` down into pairs of numbers: `12, 67, 98`. Next shift the whole of `plaintext` by the first number (`12`). Then shift the whole of `plaintext` again, apart from the first letter, by the second number (`67`). Next shift the whole of `plaintext` again, apart from the first and second letters, by the third number (`98`). This pattern is repeated until there are no more pair of numbers, and the shift cycles back to the first number (`12`). This process repeats until the end of `plaintext`, in this case 5 times.

Essentially:
1. "h" is shifted by a total of 12
2. "e" is shifted by a total of 12 + 67
3. "l" is shifted by a total of 12 + 67 + 98
4. "l" is shifted by a total of 12 + 67 + 98 + 12
5. "o" is shifted by a total of 12 + 67 + 98 + 12 + 67

## 2) Current System in place and users
There are many different encryption algorithms in place, such as MD5 to verify file integrity, SHA-256 to allow the blockchain to function and TripleDES in ATM machines. All of which are used commonly by a large amount of people. However, many use complex algorithms which take a lot of computational power and the Ryu Encryption Software poses an alternative. Although the algorithms are open source, each encryption / decryption requires **2 different inputs** allowing for security with the input text having no size restriction and the key having limited restrictions (some to ensure that the key is hard to guess). This counters rainbow tables whilst still being lightweight and rapid.

## 3) System Design Plan
Below is my plan for the first encryption algorithm (excluding 'GUI Input / Output Fields' and 'Key Processing').

### 3.1) Structured English
1. `ascii_accepted` is a list that has the ascii values from 32 up to 126
2. **INPUT** `plaintext` and `key`
3. `ciphertext` is set to a blank string
4. set `ascii_shifted` to `ascii_accepted`
5. The following loop runs `key` times on `ascii_shifted`:
    - Take the last of the list and store it in `_` (a temporary variable)
    - Each element in the list should be assigned to the index of the next element in the list
    - The first element of the list should be set as `_`
6. The following loop runs the length of `plaintext` number of times:
    - Set `i` as the loop counter
    - Find the index of `i`th letter in `plaintext` in `ascii_accepted` via a Linear Search or Python's `.index()` method
    - Add to `ciphertext` the letter that appears in the this index in the `ascii_shifted` list
7. **OUTPUT** `ciphertext`    

### 3.2) Pseudocode (Cambridge International A & AS Level Syntax)
N.B. `ascii_val()` denotes a function like Python's `chr()` where a number is converted to an ASCII character. It is not part of Cambridge International's Syntax but it is necessary for this program to function.
```python
DECLARE ascii_accepted : ARRAY[0:94] OF CHAR
DECLARE ascii_shifted : ARRAY[0:94] OF CHAR
DECLARE plaintext : STRING
DECLARE ciphertext : STRING
DECLARE key : INTEGER

DECLARE _ : STRING
DECLARE i: INTEGER
DECLARE j : INTEGER

FOR i ⬅ 32 TO 126
  ascii_accepted[i - 32] ⬅ ascii_val(i)
  ascii_shifted[i - 32] ⬅ ascii_val(i)
NEXT i

ciphertext = ""

INPUT plaintext
INPUT key

_ = ""
FOR i ⬅ 1 TO key
  _ = ascii_shifted[94]
  FOR j 0 TO 93 THEN
    ascii_shifted[j + 1] ⬅ ascii_shifted[j]
  NEXT j
  ascii_shifted[0] ⬅ _
NEXT i

FOR i ⬅ 1 TO LEN(plaintext)
  FOR j ⬅ 0 TO 94
    IF ascii_accepted[j] == plaintext[i - 1] THEN
      ciphertext ⬅ ciphertext + ascii_shifted[j]
    ENDIF
  NEXT j
NEXT i

OUTPUT ciphertext

```

## 4) Python Scripts
### 4.1) Code Explanation
#### Script Hierarchy
- `main.py` - the script that is run, importing Python's `tkinter` module to render and process the GUI
- `subscripts` - contains all the backend scripts
  - `key_product.py` - processes the user-inputted key to one that can be interpreted by the encryption algorithms
  - `verify.py` - contains a function that returns `True` if all the user data-entry requirements are met
  - `algorithms` - contains all the encryption algorithms
    - `level1.py`
    - `level2.py`
    - `level3.py`
    - `subsfunctions.py` - contain functions that have processes that are common to all three encryption algorithms

```python
#main.py
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

import subscripts.verify as verify
import subscripts.key_product as kp

import subscripts.algorithms.level1 as level1
import subscripts.algorithms.level2 as level2
import subscripts.algorithms.level3 as level3
```

#### Decryption
To allow for decryption, the algorithm just has to work in reverse. The default tertiary input for `level2.execute()` and `level3.execute()` is `-1`. If this is changed to `1`, then the algorithm will work in reverse.

```python
#Level 1
ciphertext = level1.execute(plaintext, -shift)
plaintext = level1.execute(ciphertext, shift)

#Level 2
ciphertext = level2.execute(plaintext, shift)
plaintext = level2.execute(ciphertext, shift, 1)

#Level 3
ciphertext = level3.execute(plaintext, shift)
plaintext = level3.execute(ciphertext, shift, 1)
```

#### Key Processing
The user-inputted key should be of 8 characters or more and include at least 1 non-alphanumeric character, eg: `!`. 
```python
def validation_check(k, enc):
  non_alpha_in = False
  if enc in ["1", "2", "3"]:
    if len(k) >= 8:

      for i in range(0, len(k)):
        if k[i] in non_alphanumeric_char:
          non_alpha_in = True

      return non_alpha_in
        
    else:
      return False
  else:
    return False
```

The ordinals of each character in the key are summed.
```python
sum = 0
  for i in range(0, len(key)):
    sum += ord(key[i])
```

For Level 1, the key is processed as a number between 1 and 94. This is done through Python's `%` (modulus) operator which takes the remainder after division.
```python
if sum % 95 == 0:
  return 1
else:
  return sum % 95
```

For Level 2, the Grid Cipher, the key is processed as a `( , )` tuple, where index 0 is between 1 and 3 annd index 1 is between 1 and 18. Each character then in `ascii_accepted_grid` is shifted by this vector. The first half of the digits in the ordinal sum are used to calculate index 0. The second half of the digits in the ordinal sum are used to calculate index 1.
```python
elif enclevelnum == 2:
  if len(str(sum)) % 2 == 1: #odd length
    _ = floor(len(str(sum)) / 2)
  else:
    _ = (len(str(sum)) / 2)
   
level2_upshift = int(str(sum)[0:_])
level2_rightshift = int(str(sum)[_:])

return ((level2_upshift % 4) + 1, (level2_rightshift % 18) + 1)
```

For Level 3, the key is processed as a `[[], [], [] ...]` group of lists within a list. The first two digits of the ordinal sum go inside the first list, the second two digits go inside the second list, the third two digits go inside the third list and so on. Note if a the ordinal sum had an odd number of digits - eg: `342` - it would be converted to a nunber whereby the first digits are repeated - eg: `342342` - to then be processed further.
```python
elif enclevelnum == 3:
  _ = []
  if len(str(sum)) % 2 == 1:
    sum = int(str(sum) + str(sum))
  for i in range(0, int(len(str(sum))/2)):
    _.append([int(str(sum)[(2 * i)]), int(str(sum)[(2 * i) + 1])])
  return _
```

## 5) Error Testing
Each test case should test the **User Requirements** outlined [here](). The following spreadsheet shows that the current version (`1.7.0`) is without errors since all of the test cases give the expected result.

### 5.1) Error Test Version-1.7.0 
**Errors:**
- Some Level 1 keys generated shifts which were easy to decode from eye. Eg: `plaintext=There exists a man called George` + `key=Ur4q2U^e"` = `ciphertext=4HERE_EXISTS_A_MAN_CALLED_'EORGE`
- Level 2 shift ocassionally has the following error:
```python
File "Ryu-Encryption-Version-170\subscripts\key_product.py", line 27, in return_key_product
  level2_upshift = int(str(sum)[0:_])
TypeError: slice indices must be integers or None or have an __index__ method
```

**Solutions:**
- A shift of 32 or of 63 converted Uppercase into Lowecase characters or Vice-Versa so the following code was implemented to combat this.
```python
if sum % 95 == 0:
  return 1
elif sum % 95 == 32:
  return 33
elif sum % 95 == 63:
  return 64
else:
  return sum % 95
```
- Changed the code slightly:
```python
elif enclevelnum == 2:
  #if len(str(sum)) % 2 == 1: #odd length
  _ = floor(len(str(sum)) / 2)
    #else:
      #_ = (len(str(sum)) / 2)
    
    level2_upshift = int(str(sum)[0:_])
    level2_rightshift = int(str(sum)[_:])

    return ((level2_upshift % 4) + 1, (level2_rightshift % 18) + 1)
```
